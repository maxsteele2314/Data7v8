    <h3>
      Data Chapter 7
    </h3>
    <p>
      Data in chapter 7 is typically spoken about in the form of a distribution. Distributions are typically compiled of data that has 
      been sorted such that we can find it's mean, median, mode etc.. When looking at a distribution we typiclly analize the given data
      in the form of a chart in which we look at it's overall shape and how that might deviate from our perfect bell curve.

    <h3>
      Data Chapter 8
    </h3>
    <p>
      Data in chapter 8 is refered to as the change. Usually a change is displayed in a time series line chart. The three factors 
      typically serarched for in this chart are the datas trend, seasonality and noise. According to the book it is almost impossible
      to see these featues at first glance but instead we must break the chart apart into pieces. With these charts the data can be 
      misleading as the slightest paradox or mix effect can greatly affect the data visually.

    <h2>
     Diffrences 7 versus 8 
    </h2>
   <p>
     The first clear diffrence is the terminology used to desribe these sets of data and how they move such as distribution and change.
     Secondly the chart we use typically use for each given type is diffrent varying from a histogram to a time series line chart. Another
     large and significant change is the information we can extract from the data where distribution gives use mean, median and mode our
     new type change gives us things such as trend, seasonality and noise. For a histogram we typiclly can pull data from our first visual
     glance where a time series line chart must be pulled apart to be practical.
